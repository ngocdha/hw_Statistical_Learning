    "Data science is the process of analyzing data and extrcting the relevant information from the observed data. Data science has roots in *statistics* and *computer science*. Data science is also referred to as \"big data\" or \"analytics\", however big data actually refers to the data set rather than the analysis of the data. The use of data science has become more common due to the ease of data collection, gains in computing power, and the need to make decisions based on data."

    "- **Big Data** - Big data refers to data that are too big or complex for standard data processing. Big data is also used to refer to the process of extracting information from large data sets (data science).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Learning** - (From Wikipedia) Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ”learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning evolved through computer science and AI and many of the machine learning techniques are reinvented statistical methods, but not all. Machine learning uses a computer to solve problems intractable by hand, takes data as input, uses data that represents a sample from a population, and the data is tabular.\n",
